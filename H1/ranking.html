  <h1>Statement of Ranking</h1>
  <p>Worked solo on this project. Sources included general online references and Google search results used to understand the Water Jug Puzzle. I used Google and random sources online that matched the requirements for this project. For example, I referred to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/aptitude-gq/puzzle-measure-4-litre-with-3-and-5-litre-bottle/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">this GeeksforGeeks article</a> for a step-by-step solution.</p>
